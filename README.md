My custom NSFW version of GoGoLoco 1.8.0, which I use on all my models. I have also trimmed it down a bit. (It has all that regular GoGoLoco has except flight.)

This adds NSFW poses, a new menu layout, and trimming of some unnecessary menu items to slim down.

**Two Versions** 

★ NSFW Loco V1.8.0 (Poses Only) - This just has the NSFW Poses add-ons best for Quest due to quest files size limit of 10MB.

## Coming Soon
★ NSFW Loco V1.8.0 (Poses & Emotes) - This version has Poses and Animations that can be sped up and slowed down.




Do NOT have NSFW GoGoLoco in the project with GoGoLoco they share similar Menu/Layer names and will confilct.
It now includes installer prefabs for VRCFury: https://github.com/VRCFury/VRCFury
